00:00.260 --> 00:04.920
For the upcoming Golden Week I’ll be able to take a few days away from work.

00:06.260 --> 00:09.690
I haven’t had much rest since I returned from America.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.240
I’m happy about the break.

00:12.930 --> 00:16.450
I’ve been stressed so much since I started working in the laboratory.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.200
I’d like to spend the time with Takeshi-san.

00:22.330 --> 00:24.440
I don't need to go traveling with him.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.310
I just want to be around him.

00:27.710 --> 00:30.160
I want some comfort.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.380
Am I being selfish?
